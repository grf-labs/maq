### Installation

Python bindings for `maq` can be installed from source with

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/grf-labs/maq.git#egg=maq&subdirectory=python-package"
```

Compiling from source requires Cython/Numpy. There are no C++ dependencies except the Standard Template Library, and C++11 or higher.
