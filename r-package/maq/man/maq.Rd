\arguments{
\item{reward}{A \eqn{n \cdot K} matrix of test set treatment effect estimates \eqn{\hat \tau(X_i)}.
(Note: the estimated function \eqn{\hat \tau(\cdot)} should be constructed on a held-out training set)}

\item{cost}{A \eqn{n \cdot K} matrix of test set costs \eqn{C(X_i) > 0}, where entry (i, k)
measures the cost of assigning the i-th unit the k-th treatment arm.
If the costs does not vary by unit, only by arm, this can also be a K-length vector.
(Note: these costs need not be denominated on the same scale as the treatment effect estimates).}

\item{DR.scores}{An \eqn{n \cdot K} matrix of test set evaluation scores used to form an estimate of
Q(B). With known treatment propensities \eqn{P[W_i|X_i]},
these scores can be constructed via inverse-propensity weighting, i.e, with entry (i, k) equal to
\eqn{\frac{\mathbf{1}(W_i=k)Y_i}{P[W_i=k | X_i]} - \frac{\mathbf{1}(W_i=0)Y_i}{P[W_i=0 | X_i]}}.
In observational settings where \eqn{P[W_i|X_i]} has to be estimated, then an alternative is to
construct these scores via augmented inverse-propensity weighting (AIPW) - yielding a doubly
robust estimate of the Qini curve (for details, see the paper).}

\item{budget}{The maximum spend per unit, \eqn{B_{max}}, to fit the Qini curve on.
Setting this to NULL (Default), will fit the path up to a maximum spend per unit
where each unit that is expected to benefit (that is, \eqn{\hat \tau_k(X_i)>0}) is treated.}

\item{target.with.covariates}{If TRUE (Default), then the policy \eqn{\pi_B} takes covariates
\eqn{X_i} into account. If FALSE, then the policy only takes the average reward
\eqn{\bar \tau = E[\hat \tau(X_i)]} and average costs \eqn{\bar C = E[C(X_i)]} into account when
allocating treatment. This can be used to construct a baseline Qini curve to assess the value
of treatment targeting based on covariates.}

\item{R}{Number of bootstrap replicates for computing standard errors. Default is 0
(only point estimates are computed).}

\item{paired.inference}{Whether to allow for paired tests with other Qini curves fit on the same
evaluation data. If TRUE (Default) then the path of bootstrap replicates are stored in order to perform
paired comparisons that account for the correlation between curves evaluated on the same data. This
takes memory on the order of \eqn{O(RnK)} and requires the comparison objects to be fit with
the same seed and R values as well as the same number of samples.}

\item{sample.weights}{Weights given to an observation in estimation.
If NULL, each observation is given the same weight. Default is NULL.}

\item{clusters}{Vector of integers or factors specifying which cluster each observation corresponds to,
which are used to construct clustered standard errors.
Default is NULL (ignored).}

\item{tie.breaker}{An optional permutation of the integers 1 to n used to
break potential ties in the optimal treatment allocation
(only relevant if \eqn{\hat \tau(X)} takes on the same values for different samples
\eqn{X_i} and \eqn{X_j}).
If NULL, the ties are broken by the lowest sample id (i.e. the sample appearing first in the data).
Default is NULL.}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads used in bootstrap replicates. By default, the number of threads
is set to the maximum hardware concurrency.}

\item{seed}{The seed of the C++ random number generator. Default is 42.}

\description{
Consider \eqn{k = 1, \ldots, K} mutually exclusive and costly treatment arms,
where k = 0 is a zero-cost control arm. Let \eqn{\hat \tau(\cdot)} be an \emph{estimated}
multi-armed treatment effect function and \eqn{C(\cdot)} a known cost function
(where the k-th element of these vectors measures \eqn{E[Y_i(k) - Y_i(0) | X_i]} and
\eqn{E[C_i(k) - C_i(0) | X_i]} where \eqn{Y_i(k)} are potential outcomes corresponding
to the k-th treatment state, \eqn{C_i(k)} the cost of assigning unit i the k-th arm,
and \eqn{X_i} a set of covariates). We provide estimates of the Qini curve:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{Q(B) = E[\langle \pi_B(X_i), \tau(X_i)\rangle], B \in (0, B_{max}],}
}
which is the expected gain, at any budget constraint B, when assigning treatment in accordance
to \eqn{\pi_B}, the treatment policy that optimally selects
which arm to assign to which unit while incurring a cost less than or equal to B in expectation
when using the given functions \eqn{\hat \tau(\cdot)} and \eqn{C(\cdot)}:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\pi_B = argmax_{\pi} \left\{E[\langle \pi(X_i), \hat \tau(X_i) \rangle]: E[\langle \pi(X_i), C(X_i) \rangle] \leq B \right\}.}
}
At a budget B, the k-th element of \eqn{\pi_B(X_i)} is 1 if assigning the k-th arm
to the i-th unit is optimal, and 0 otherwise.
The Qini curve can be used to quantify the value, as measured by the expected gain over
assigning each unit the control arm when using the estimated function
\eqn{\hat \tau(\cdot)} with cost structure \eqn{C(\cdot)} to allocate treatment,
as we vary the available budget \eqn{B}.
